TTINY ML WORKSHOP

Potential,  the  Robotics  Club,  hosted  a  comprehensive  AI  workshop
on  22  January  2025.  The  session  began  with  foundational  concepts,
catering  to  all  attendees.  Subsequently,  the  workshop  introduced
Multi-Layer  Perceptrons,  computer  vision,  and  TinyML  in  concise,
engaging segments.

For  participants  with  prior  experience,  the  session  delved  into
advanced  topics  like  Deep  Learning  and  Hugging  Face.  Practical,
simultaneous  coding  sessions  on  participants'  laptops  reinforced
theoretical  knowledge,  ensuring  active  learning.  The  workshop
culminated  in  a  dynamic  live  demonstration  of  five  projects,
showcasing real-world applications.

Projects  included  Edge  Impulse,  Hugging  Face  transformers,  LLM
Quantization,  TinyYolo,  and  Anomaly  Detection  with  KNN.  The
diverse  project  showcase  provided  insights  into  cutting-edge  AI
technologies.  Participation  certificates  were  distributed  to  all
attendees, recognizing their engagement and learning.

ROBOTIC OS WORKSHOP

Potential, the Robotics Club, organized an insightful seminar on 26 February 2025, focusing
on  robotic  operating  systems.  The  session  explored  the  critical  distinctions  between  ROS
and  traditional  machine  operating  systems,  providing  a  foundational  understanding.  The
seminar delved into the intricacies of robot OS architecture, dissecting its core components.

The  session  further  elaborated  on  the  concept  of  nodes  and  ROS  topics,  illustrating  their
functionality  through  the  master-slave  approach.  This  practical  explanation  helped
participants  grasp  the  underlying  principles  of  robotic  communication.  The  seminar's
format, akin to a focused lecture, facilitated in-depth discussions and knowledge sharing.

The  smaller  group  size  allowed  for  personalized  interactions  and  clarified  complex
concepts.  Participant  certificates  will  be  distributed  shortly,  acknowledging
their
engagement in this specialized robotics seminar. The event successfully equipped attendees
with a deeper understanding of robot operating systems.

CODE DETONATE â€“ RASPBERRY PI

Potential's  Code  Detonate,  held  on  24  February
2025, offered a hands-on Raspberry Pi experience.
The  session  began  with  an  overview  of  Raspberry
Pi  basics,  covering  key  features,  GPIO  pins,  OS
setup,  and  diverse  applications.  This  foundational
knowledge
the  practical
the
debugging challenge.

Participants  then  engaged  in  a  45-minute  debugging  exercise,  where  Raspberry  Pi  setups
represented  crucial  aircraft  systems.  The  Aircraft  Hijack  theme  transformed  the
components  into  jammed  systems,  requiring  participants  to  revive  them.  This  immersive
approach fostered problem-solving skills and practical application of learned concepts.

The participants' success in restoring the simulated aircraft systems highlighted their ability
to  apply  theoretical  knowledge  in  a  high-pressure  scenario.  The  event  proved  to  be  an
engaging  and  educational  experience.  Participant  certificates  will  be  distributed  shortly,
recognizing their successful completion of the "Code Detonate" challenge.
