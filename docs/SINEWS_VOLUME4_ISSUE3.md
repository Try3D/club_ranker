GUEST LECTURE ON ‘SDN BASED SECURITY
ANALYSIS IN CLOUD COMPUTING’

The Department of CSE hosted an engaging guest lecture on “SDN-Based Security Analysis in
Cloud  Computing”,  featuring  Dr.  Neha  Agarwal,  Assistant  Professor  at  IIIT  Sri  city  on  7
October  2024.  The  session,  organised  by  Dr.  Padmavathi  and  Dr.  Rohit  Kumar,  aimed  to
introduce students to the application of SDN in enhancing cloud security.

Dr. Neha Agarwal provided a comprehensive overview of how SDN, combined with machine
learning  and  advanced  analytics,  offers  cloud  providers  a  robust,  adaptive  security
framework to counter evolving cyber threats. She explained that traditional security models
often struggle in cloud environments due to their dynamic and scalable nature. SDN, with its
centralized  control  and  programmability,  enables  more  effective  management  of  network
traffic and threat detection.

The session covered various aspects of SDN, including scalability issues and the integration
complexities  with  existing  cloud  infrastructure.  Dr.  Neha  also  highlighted  SDN’s  ability  to
offer  real-time  visibility  and  dynamic  policy  enforcement,  making  it  a  promising  tool  for
securing cloud environments.

modern  cybersecurity  challenges  such  as  DDoS  attacks  and  data  breaches.  In  addition,
Dr.  Neha  touched  upon  the  future  of  cloud  security  and  the  ongoing  research  in  SDN’s
integration with emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence.

This  forward-looking  perspective  gave  students  insight  into  understanding  of  SDN’s
transformative role in cloud security, inspiring them to explore in this exciting domain.

GUEST LECTURE ON ‘WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO THINK?’

On 9 October 2024, Siddharth S, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Sai University, delivered
a  lecture  introducing  students  at  the  School  of  Law  to  the  art  of  thinking.  His  talk,
supplemented  by  engaging  visual  aids,  explored  the  process  and  morality  of  thinking,
emphasizing that it is a deliberate activity distinct from other mental actions.

Dr. Siddharth began by inviting students to share their definitions of thinking, sparking lively
discussions.  He  clarified  that  most  responses  described  repeating  or  other  forms  of  mental
activity, rather than genuine thinking. He explained that true thinking involves transcending
the  constraints  of  the  external  world  to  create  something  original  internally,  using  external
ideas and objects as building blocks.

To  illustrate  this  point,  he  engaged  students  in  group  discussions  on  the  feasibility  of  ‘One
Nation,  One  Election,’  encouraging  them  to  critically  analyze  different  perspectives  and
engage  in  thoughtful  debate.  He  then  explored  examples  of  ‘wrong’  thinking,  challenging
misconceptions. For instance, he argued that immoral thoughts, such as advocating violence,
are  not  inherently  "wrong"  thinking.  Instead,  the  fallacies  of  thinking  lie  in  logical  errors,
such as the inference: “Since pens are writing instruments, all writing instruments are pens.”

Despite its evolving and ephemeral nature, he distinguished true thinking from its imitative
forms. With elements of judgment, subjectivity, and originality at its core, he emphasized the
critical importance of understanding this process.

GUEST LECTURE ON ORAL PRESENTATION
AND ARGUMENT SKILLS

On  9  October  2024,  the  SNU  School  of  Law  was  privileged  to  host  Mr.  Sanchit  Shivakumar,

arguments  in  mooting.  An  accomplished  international  mooter,  Mr.  Sanchit  shared  his
expertise through a session titled “May It Please the Court: A Guide to Oral Arguments.”

The  presentation,  enhanced  by  engaging  visual  aids,  began  with  a  captivating  case  study
highlighting  the  importance  of  "court  craft"—the  art  of  understanding  judicial  thought
processes  and  responding  effectively  to  judges’  questions.  Mr.  Sanchit  drew  from  his
experiences as a student at NUJS, Kolkata, discussing the value of mooting in developing key
legal  skills,  advancing  careers,  and  fostering  a  passion  for  law.  He  also  provided  a
comprehensive overview of the fundamental structure of moot court competitions.

In the second half, Mr. Sanchit offered practical tips for effective oral advocacy, including how
to structure arguments using the state-explain-cite framework, the importance of courtroom
etiquette,  and  the  critical  elements  of  persuasive  advocacy.  Students  actively  engaged  in  an
interactive  exercise,  defending  Mrs.  Carlill  in  the  landmark  Carlill  v.  Carbolic  Smoke  Ball
Company case using the framework.

Mr.  Sanchit's  guidance  on  procedural  provisions,  as  well  as  his  insights  into  the  law  and
presenting  arguments,  ensured  that  students  were  well-prepared  for  both  their  upcoming
Moot (Contracts) evaluation and future moot court competitions.

economic frameworks. Her insights were enriched as a social reformer and a former
bureaucrat, adding significant depth to the discussion.

It was a truly enriching experience that provided valuable insights into the relevance

November 2024. The session aimed to provide students with a deeper understanding
of  the  contributions  of  the  Alvars,  particularly  Nammalvar,  to  the  development  of
Vaishnavism.

Mr.  Pradeep  began  the  lecture  by  detailing  the  birth  of  Nammalvar,  his  association
with  his  guru  Madhurakavi,  and  the  sacred  site  of  Alwar  Tirunagari.  He  highlighted
the  essence  of  Bhakti  —  complete  devotion  and  surrender  to  the  divine,  seeing  the
divine presence in all aspects of the world, both animate and inanimate.

One  of  the  key  moments  of  the  lecture  was  the  discussion  of  the  Naalaayiram  Divya
Prabandham,  often  called  the  Tamil  Veda.  This  revered  collection  of  devotional
hymns  plays  a  significant  role  in  the  Bhakti  movement.  Mr.  Pradeep  brought  the
hymns  to  life  by  reciting  verses  from  the  Periya  Tiruvantati.  His  soulful  recitations
captivated  the  audience,  offering  a  glimpse  into  the  profound  spiritual  poetry  that
continues to inspire generations.

The  lecture  was  further  enhanced  by  a  video  highlighting  how  these  hymns  are
chanted  in  temples  across  Tamil  Nadu.  Each  rendition  demonstrated  the  distinct
cultural richness of the region, providing students with a deeper appreciation of the
traditions that have shaped the spiritual landscape of Tamil Nadu.

The  session  was  not  only  a  valuable  educational  experience  but  also  a  deeply
inspiring  one,  helping  students  grasp  the  cultural  and  spiritual  significance  of  the
Bhakti  movement.  It  encouraged  to  appreciate  the  diversity  of  traditions  in  Tamil
Nadu  and  the  enduring  legacy  of  figures  like  Nammalvar  in  shaping  the  region's
religious and philosophical identity.

The  lecture  provided  a  profound  exploration  of  the  spiritual  depth  of  the  Bhakti
movement,  inviting  students  to  reflect  on  its  lasting  impact  on  society  and
spirituality.

students  of  Shiv  Nadar  School  of  Law.  Renowned  for  his  expertise  in  intellectual
property law, media, and technology, Professor Liang explored the complex interplay
between creativity and piracy in the digital age.

UNIVERSITY UPDATES

The  lecture  built  on  themes  of  “free  culture”  and  creativity  in  cinema  previously
introduced  through  works  such  as  Lawrence  Lessig’s  Free  Culture  and  Faiza  Ahmad
Khan’s  2008  documentary  Supermen  of  Malegaon  Drawing  on  his  academic
background  and  personal  connections  to  these  authors,  Professor  Liang  delivered  a
captivating lecture that provided students with deeper insights into these influential
works.

Central  to  the  discussion  was  the  relationship  between  copyright  and  culture,
emphasizing  how  objects  of  copyright  are  deeply  embedded  in  cultural  contexts.  He
illustrated  this  dynamic  through  examples  such  as  the  Laapata  Ladies  and  Maavaa
plagiarism  controversies,  as  well  as  historical  cases  like  the  debates  surrounding
Franz Kafka’s works and the Marx Brothers-Warner Brothers copyright dispute.

Professor  Liang  highlighted  how  technological  advancements  over  the  past  century
have  complicated  the  question  of  copyright.  From  the  vinyl-to-cassette  transition  to
the  ongoing  generative  AI  revolution,  he  noted  the  dual  role  of  technology  in
fostering modernism and enabling piracy.

Professor  Liang  issued  a  call  to  action,  urging  students  to  reclaim  user  sovereignty
by  “taking  apart”  their  computers,  phones,  music,  and  cultural  artefacts.  He
emphasized  that  this  act  of  re-engagement  is  essential  to  navigate  the  complexities
of  creativity  and  ownership  in  the  digital  age.  The  lecture  prompted  the  students  to
critically examine their relationship with technology.
