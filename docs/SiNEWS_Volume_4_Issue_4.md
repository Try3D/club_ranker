TALK BY M  . PRANAV GUPTA ON ‘POLITICAL ECONOMY OF
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCES IN INDIA’

r

On  19  February  2025,  Mr.  Pranav  Gupta  hosted  a  thought-provoking  lecture  on  Political
Economy  of  Environmental  Clearances  in  India  at  the  School  of  Law.  Holding  academic
credentials  from  UC  Berkely,  the  London  School  of  Economics,  and  St.  Stephen’s  College,
Delhi, Mr. Gupta’s expertise lies in political science and economics. His academic focus is on
research,  including  on  the  politics  of  public  service  delivery,  party  systems,  and  voting

Mr.  Gupta  began  by  explaining
the
importance  of  environmental  permits  as  a
means  of  balancing  two  key  government
objectives:
and
environmental  sustainability.  India,  being
an  emerging  economy,  thus  finds  the
environmental clearance system especially
necessary.  The  existing  regime  works
through state-specific SEIAA and SEAC
bureaucratic  bodies.  Their  verification  procedure  consists  almost  invariably  of  screening,
scoping,  public  consultation,  and  approval,  but  processing  time  variations  and  spatial
differences may occur.

These  variations  were  substantiated  by  Mr.  Gupta  with  his  own  research.  His  and  his
colleagues’ research showed that, while some industries acquired regulatory approval four
months  earlier  than  others,  the  high  end  of  processing  time  was  one  year  –  this  far
surpassed  the  mandated  105  days.  Several  such  graphs  were  shown,  tracking  regulatory
responsiveness,  the  relationship  between  committee  size  and  processing  time,  change  in
committee tenure, and approval rates across the tenure of a government with an emphasis
on  election  periods;  this  data  was  collected  from  each  constituency  in  India,  collating
information from over 63,000 construction projects.

Mr.  Gupta  emphasized  throughout  the  various  contingent  factors  in  environmental
approval.  Politicians,  bureaucrats,  and  environmental  regulators  shape  the  process  in
unexpected ways, but move towards efficiency in pockets and increments.

MOOT WORKSHOP

facilitated  a

Mr.  Shaurya,  an  established  and  renowned
mooter  and  guide,
two-day
workshop  on  the  art  of  mooting.  The  first  day
began  with  an  introductory  session  aimed  at
familiarizing  students  with  the  concept  and
practice of moot courts.

He  opened  the  session  with  a  discussion  on  the  fundamentals  of  mooting,  clarifying
common  misconceptions  around  the  topic.  He  elaborated  on  the  dual  aspects  of  mooting:
written advocacy, which is based on writing memorials or briefs, and oral advocacy, which
is  centered  on  speaking.  Drawing  from  his  own  journey  as  a  law  student,  Mr.  Shaurya
shared  his  experiences  participating  in  prestigious  international  moot  competitions.  This
fine-grained overview gave students a basis for understanding how moot courts operated.

His  observations  and  advice  provided  useful  lessons  on  how  to  tackle  the  issues  of  these
seemingly  'hard'  competitions  and  underlined  the  necessity  of  preparation,  research  skills,
and confidence. To further promote students' hands-on skills, he presented a moot problem
during the second session.

He  walked  the  students  through  step  by  step  in  analyzing  and  dissecting  the  problem,
illustrating  how  to  effectively  apply  legal  principles.  This  practical  exercise  enabled

One  of  the  standout  features  of  Mela’25  was  its  student-run  stalls,  offering  young

of  stalls,  there  was  no  shortage  of  eager  visitors,  making  the  event  both  a  learning
experience and a commercial success for students.

The  Lakshya  team  played  a  crucial  role  in  planning,  organizing,  and  managing  the  event,

provided  an  introduction  to  Sundaram  Fasteners,  a  leading  name  in  the  manufacturing
sector known for its precision-engineered automotive components. The introductory session
covered  the  company’s  history,  growth,  and  its  contributions  to  the  automotive  and

GUEST TALK BY PROF. SUMIT GANGULY ON ‘US-INDIA
RELATIONS IN THE SECOND TRUMP ERA’

Prof. Sumit Ganguly, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, delivered a guest lecture at the
School  of  Law  on  US-India  Relations  in  the  Second  Trump  Era.  The  talk  was  moderated  by
Prof. Vinay Sitapati, Associate Dean of the School of Law, and marked the addition of two of
Prof. Ganguly’s acclaimed books to the School of Law Library.

Prof.  Ganguly  is  an  expert  on  US-India  relations,  having  academic  and  professional
credentials  from  various  institutions  including  Rajaratnam  School  of  International  Studies
at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and Indiana University, Bloomington.

The  lecture  was  structured  around  three  key  themes:  the  history  of  US-India  relations,  the
re-election  of  Donald  Trump  as  the  US  President,  and  its  future  impact  on  India.  He  began
his  lecture  by  analyzing  US-India  relations  throughout  the  years,  starting  from  the  first
POTUS visit to India.

The  re-election  of  Trump,  however,  led  to  unintended  consequences  for  his  voters.  The
average Trump voter was a middle-class worker with a high school diploma, Prof. Ganguly
explained, and would be the victim of price rises due to Trump’s sanction policies.

An important point he raised was the lack of commitment by Trump to preserve democracy
in  the  US,  and  his  view  of  foreign  relations  to  be  transactional,  informing  his  recent
sanctions  on  imports  from  India,  and  thus  forgoing  his  predecessors’  attempts  at  goodwill.
The  interactive  session  at  the  end  featured  questions  raised  about  Indians  in  the  Trump
administration and the recent clash of interests around the Arab Gulf.

TALK BY D  . RAHUL VERMA ON “POLITICAL FAMILIES AND
DEMOCRACY IN MODERN INDIA”

r

On  the  25  March  2025,  Dr.  Rahul  Verma,  proclaimed  political  scientist,  addressed  the
students of Shiv Nadar School of Law about the dynamics of political families in India and
their relationship with democracy. Drawing on an original dataset spanning Uttar Pradesh
elections from 1974 to 2019, Dr. Rahul argued that the longevity of these families hinges on
economic  and  political  diversification.  He  distinguished  between  enduring  families,
declining ones, and newly emerging dynasties.

His central thesis was that families who diversify their economic resources, moving beyond
traditional  land  ownership  or  single  industries,  and  who  cultivate  diverse  political  power
bases,  rather  than  relying  solely  on  a  single  constituency  or  network,  demonstrate  greater
resilience.  This  diversification  enables  them  to  weather  political  storms  and  adapt  to
evolving  socio-economic  conditions.  He  used  a  compelling  village  case  study  from  Uttar
Pradesh and Maharashtra to illustrate how families failing to adapt become vulnerable and
start to decay.

This  analysis  highlighted  a  critical  shift  in  Indian  democracy,  suggesting  that  traditional
power structures are being reshaped by economic forces and changing political landscapes.
Understanding  the  rise  and  fall  of  these  families,  Dr.  Verma  concluded,  provides  valuable
insight  into  the  evolving  nature  of  representative  democracy  in  India.  The  lecture  sparked
considerable  discussion  among  the  students  about  the  implications  of  these  findings  for
Indian politics.

TALK BY DR. BADRINATH SRINIVASAN ON "UNDERSTANDING
STATUTES"

The lecture outlined various types of statutes, including codifying, consolidating, amending,
declaratory,  and  repealing  statutes.  Each  serves  a  distinct  purpose  in  shaping  the  legal
landscape.

Dr.  Badrinath  started  the  talk  with  defining  and  highlighting  the  nuances  about  legislative
competence. In India, legislative competence is governed by Article 246 of the Constitution,
which  divides  law-making  powers  between  the  Union  and  State  legislatures  through  the
Union,  State,  and  Concurrent  Lists.  Article  254(1)  addresses  inconsistencies  in  laws  made
under the Concurrent List, prioritizing parliamentary law.

After  helping  students  understand  this  important  information,  Dr.  Badrinath  moved  on  to
the concept of how the structure of the statutes is mostly submerged in its table of contents.
He  used  the  Arbitration  and  Conciliation  Act,  1996,  and  the  Contract  Act  as  case  studies  to
help  the  students  understand  the  hidden  structure  in  these  acts.  The  Arbitration  Act,
structured  into  parts  and  chapters,  covers  domestic  and  international  arbitration,
enforcement  of  foreign  awards,  and  conciliation.  The  Contract  Act's  arrangement,  though
seemingly  arbitrary,  reveals  a  logical  progression  from  general  principles  to  specific

Ultimately,  the  lecture  underscores  the  importance  of  understanding  the  structure  of
statutes,  including  their  objectives,  legislative  competence,  and  organizational  framework.
This  knowledge  enhances  the  ability  to  interpret  and  apply  legal  provisions  effectively,
whether  in  arbitration,  contract  law,  or  other  areas.  Recognizing  the  order  and  purpose
behind a statute's arrangement is key to unlocking its meaning.
