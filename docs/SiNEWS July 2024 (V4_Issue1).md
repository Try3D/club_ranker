of
Sayonara’24.  Although
the  name

fleeting.  The  soon-to-be  graduates

nervousness  and  the  forked  paths

The  mini  auditorium  was  flooded

Sayonara.  The  event  wasn't
just
about  saying  goodbye;  it  was  about
celebrating  the  bonds  they  had

Though  regularity  remains,  the  vibrant  chaos  of
college – from impromptu campus events to late-night
chats with friends – will be replaced by the solitude of
the  professional  sphere.  The  once  vibrant  'Nova'  fades
into  a  nostalgic  memory  as  the  graduating  class
embraces  the  unknown,  a  hopeful  'Happy  New  Year'
echoing
in  their  hearts.  Although  three  days  of
farewell-like  festivities  eased  the  transition,  the  shift
from socializing with a constant stream of faces to the
potential  isolation  of  a  new  job  is  stark.  They  walk
away  with  a  flicker  of  hope  as  the  future  beckons,
clinging  to  the  connections  forged  during  these
