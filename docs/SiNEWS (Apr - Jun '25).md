The  inaugural  edition  of  the  SSN-SNUC  Intra-MUN  Conference  2025  was  successfully
conducted on 2 and 3 April 2025, marking a significant milestone in the collaborative
journey of the MUN Societies of SSN and SNUC. Executed entirely by student members
under the expert guidance of their faculty coordinators, the event was a testament to
the organizational excellence nurtured within both institutions.

The Organizing Committee, formed through elections in March, comprised Secretariat
members  chosen  by  the  organising  committee  of  SSN-SNUC  MUN  ’25  and  the  core
committees  of  the  two  societies.  Together,  they  planned  every  aspect  of  the
conference,  including  the  venue,  committee  formation,  and  selection  of  Executive
Board members.

Five dynamic committees—ECOSOC, UNHRC, UNSC, UNGA, and the IPC Reporting and
Photography  Columns—convened  over  two  days,  featuring  a  curated  set  of
themselves.  The
accomplished  Executive  Board  members  from
International  Press  Corps  (IPC),  comprising  reporters  and  photojournalists,  played  a
vital role by holding delegates and leadership across committees accountable through
sharp reporting and visual documentation.

the  societies

The  committees  addressed  pressing  global  and  societal  issues:  ECOSOC  explored  the
role of microfinance in development, UNGA tackled the Israel-Palestine conflict, UNSC
engaged  with  post-Cold  War  peacebuilding,  and  UNHRC  examined  the  challenges
faced by individuals with gender dysphoria.

The  conference  concluded  with  awards  presented  by  Dr.  Martha  Karunakar,  Faculty
Coordinator  of  the  MUN  Society,  and  a  collective  sense  of  accomplishment—an  apt
closure to weeks of unwavering diligence and dedication.

On 2 April 2025, Prof. Siddharth Mallavarapu gave a guest lecture at the School of Law
on  International  Law  and  International  Relations:  Contemplating  A  Teaching
Curriculum  and  Research  Programme  for  the  Global  South.  The  talk  was  held  in  the
Law Library of the Shiv Nadar School of Law.

Prof.  Mallavarapu  is  a  writer,  researcher,  and  Professor,  teaching  at  the  Department
of  International  Relations  and  Governance  Studies  at  the  Shiv  Nadar  Institution  of
Eminence  (SNIoE).  He  has  published  in  the  journal  Global  Constitution  and  several
other publications, and is the co-editor of International Relations: Perspectives for the
Global South. His areas of research include inter alia Indian thinking in international
relations,  Gandhian  intuitions  on  security,  imperialism,  international  law,  and  war,
and the nature of international punishments.

In his lecture, Prof. Mallavarapu surveyed each school of thought on international law
and  international  relations  (IL-IR),  highlighting  their  respective  features  and
prominent  authors.  Each  school  of  thought  conceptualized  international  relations  in
different  ways  and  through  different  lenses;  the  headlining  ideologies  were  post-war
political  realism  and  the  liberal  response,  with  others  being  structural  neorealism,
behaviouralism, and scientific rationalism.

A  few,  more  fringe  ideologies  were  discussed,  such  as  the  R2P  doctrine,  Active
Network  Theory,  Third-World  Approaches  to  International  Law  (TWAIL),  and
International  Marxist  Approaches  to  International  Law  (IMAIL).  Against  these
conceptualizations of IL-IR, compliance with international laws were held up to assess
the  former’s  applicability.  These  situations  included  India’s  non-compliance  with  the
Nuclear Proliferation Treaty, on which Prof. Mallavarapu has extensively researched.

The aim of this lecture was to discuss analytical insights and political gains that might
be gleaned from an anchored pursuit of such a joint approach to the study of IL-IR in
the  context(s)  we  inhabit,  following  his  research  on  developing  a  curriculum  and
research  structure  for  IL-IR  in  the  Global  South,  as  Prof.  Mallavarapu  communicated
in his pre-lecture brief.

On  4  April  2025,  SSN  Trust  celebrated  its  25   Annual  Sports  Day,  a  testament  to  its
enduring legacy of promoting sports and holistic development. The event commenced
with a warm welcome address by Sports Secretary Mr. Harshkumar.

th

The  Chief  Guest,  Shrimathi  K.  Shamini—an  SSN  alumna,  international  Table  Tennis
player,  Commonwealth  Games  Silver  Medalist,  three-time  National  Champion,  and
Senior Manager at IOCL—graced the occasion and delivered an inspiring address. She
spoke  passionately  about  the  inevitable  role  of  sports  in  shaping  her  personal  and
professional journey.

Dr.  P.  Balaji,  Director  of  Physical  Education,  presented  a  comprehensive  Annual
Report  highlighting  the  year's  achievements.  Awards  were  distributed  to  deserving
staff  and  students,  with  a  dedicated  segment  for  Special  Awards  recognizing
exceptional  contributions.  Captains  and  Sports  Secretaries  were  honored  with  gift
vouchers. The best player was also conferred with a special gift voucher.

The  event  was  drawn  to  a  grand  close  with  the  presentation  of  the  Overall
Championship Shield, followed by a vote of thanks.

The  halls  of  SNUC  echoed  with  laughter,  nostalgia,  and  tears  as  the  juniors  came
together to bid a warm and memorable farewell to the B.Sc Economics (Data Science)
Batch  of  2025  on  9  April  2025  and  was  a  perfect  blend  of  heartfelt  messages,
celebrations,  and  creative  flair  showcasing  the  deep  bond  shared  between  the
graduating batch and their juniors.

The  event  began  on  a  sentimental  note  with  a  special  video  message  from  the
esteemed faculty members. Each professor shared words of encouragement, personal
anecdotes,  along  with  best  wishes  for  the  graduating  students.  The  video  served  not
just as a reminder of the academic journey traversed but also as a touching tribute to
the growth and transformation witnessed by the students over the past three years.

What followed was a vibrant showcase of talent and effort by the juniors. A series of
cultural  performances  lit  up  the  stage,  ranging  from  soulful  musical  renditions  to
high-energy  dance  numbers  that  reflected  the  unique  quirks  of  college  life.  These
performances were not only entertaining but also symbolic of the love and admiration
the juniors held for their seniors.

Adding a personal and lasting touch to the occasion was the unveiling of the farewell
yearbook,  a  beautifully  curated  collection  of  photographs,  memories,  and  messages
dedicated to the outgoing batch.

It  captured  snapshots  of  classroom  moments  and  all  the  seemingly  small  instances
that  made  college  life  unforgettable.  The  yearbook  stood  as  a  token  of  appreciation,
crafted with care and creativity by the juniors.

The  farewell  was  more  than  just  an  event—  it  was  a  celebration  of  friendships,
growth,  and  the  beginning  of  new  journeys.  As  the  Batch  of  2025  steps  into  the  next
phase  of  their  lives,  they  carry  with  them  the  warmth  of  this  evening,  the  wisdom  of
their mentors, and the memories that will forever be etched in their hearts.

On 9 April 2025, Ms. Insiyah Vahanvaty gave a talk on her book, The Fearless Judge, at
the School of Law. The book chronicles the life and legacy of her grandfather, Justice
A.M. Ahmadi. During her session, Vahanvathy delved into the remarkable journey of
Justice Ahmadi, with her book serving as a testament to his courage and integrity.

Ms.  Vahanvaty  talked  about  how  Justice  Ahmadi  was  one  of  the  very  few  Muslim
judges  to  reach  such  a  high  office  in  India,  especially  at  a  time  when  the  country’s
social  and  political  landscape  was  highly  complex  and  often  gave  rise  to  massive
communal riots and tensions. She also highlighted his passion and respect towards the
constitution and its integral components, such as secularism.

Ms.  Vahanvaty  emphasized  her  grandfather’s  unwavering  commitment  to  rationality
and  logic,  traits  that  defined  his  judicial  philosophy  and  decision-making.  She  also
emphasized his fearless nature—how he never hesitated to voice his opinions, even if
they  went  against  prevailing  sentiments  or  powerful  interests.  She  then  pointed  out
how Justice Ahmadi penned the minority dissenting judgment in the Babri issue, even
though he was next in line to become the Chief Justice and might face severe scrutiny
and troubles for not falling in line with the dominant opinion.

The  book  explores  key  chapters  of  his  career,  such  as  his  handling  of  the  Bhopal  Gas
Tragedy,  Babri  Masjid,  etc,  emphasizing  his  deep  devotion  to  fairness  and
constitutional  morality.  Vahanvaty  also  provided  insights  about  the  impact  these
events had on their household, recollecting moments from these crucial turn points –
that would end up as cornerstones of the country’s legal arena.

Ms. Vahnavaty’s talk encouraged the students to uphold the values of courage, reason,
and justice, echoing the legacy of her grandfather as depicted in her book.

On  30  April  2025,  Prof.  A.  R.  Venkatachalapathy  visited  the  School  of  Law  to  discuss
his  recent  book,  Swadeshi  Steam:  V.O.  Chidambaram  Pillai  and  the  Battle  against  the
British Maritime Empire. The book talk took place in the Moot Court of the Law School
building.

Prof. Venkatachalapathy is a multi-award-winning writer, editor and historian, as well
as  a  Professor  at  the  Madras  Institute  of  Development  Studies,  Chennai.  He  was
awarded  the  Sahitya  Akademi  award  in  2024  for  his  Tamil-language  research  book
Tirunelveeli  Ezucciyum  Vaa.  Vuu.  Ci.  Yum  1908,  and  has  taught  at  universities  in
Tirunelveli, Chennai, Singapore, and Chicago. His areas of research include Dravidian
history, print history, caste politics, the politics of language and literary cultures, and
coffee.

Swadeshi Steam comprises forty years of research by Prof. Venkatachalapathy into the
life  of  V.  O.  Chidambaram  Pillai  (monikered  VOC),  the  famed  freedom  fighter  of
Tirunelveli.  Prof.    Venkatachalapathy  explored  the  historical  background  in  which
VOC began its shipping enterprise and the sociopolitical foundations it built on.

The Professor mapped out VOC’s story from his profession as a low-level lawyer to his
arrest  in  1906  and  the  subsequent  problems  he  and  his  business  faced;  the  talk  also
delved into the nuances of colonial maritime trade politics, colonialist strategies, and
colonial-era funding accessibility.

Prof. Venkatachalapathy had been deeply intrigued by VOC since he was a schoolchild,
he  explained;  it  was  in  search  of  the  freedom  fighter’s  story  that  he  became  a
historian. His aim was to understand VOC in his social and historical context, and he
sourced his research from archives and police reports so as to achieve this goal.

As  part  of  the  initiative  to  form  a  Language  Translation  Research  Group,  Shiv  Nadar

"Nature is not a place to visit; it is home."

On 5 April 2025, World Environment Day was commemorated with a meaningful tree-
planting  ceremony  held  on  campus.  The  event  brought  together  members  of  the
university community in a shared act of environmental responsibility.

Our  esteemed  Vice  Chancellor,  Prof.  S.K.  Bhattacharya,  and  our  dedicated  Registrar,
Prof.  N.  Nallusamy,  along  with  faculty  members  and  administrative  staff,  actively
participated  in  the  tree-planting  activity,  demonstrating  a  symbolic  act  of  hope,

I still remember my first day at SNUC like it was yesterday. Walking
into  the  Economics  department,  I  felt  like  a  complete  outsider
because I had zero background in economics. I came from a different
academic  stream,  and  for  me,  just  being  part  of  this  program  felt
like climbing a mountain blindfolded. I wondered if I truly belonged.

But something magical happened. The faculty, and more importantly,
my  batchmates,  made  the  journey  smoother  than  I  ever  imagined.  I
remember one of my friends patiently teaching me economics while I
helped them with mathematics. I still smile at how we traded subjects
like  snacks.  And  Pushpa  Ma’am,  our  HOD,  used  to  check  in  with  us
every week: “Were you able to follow the syllabus? Are you managing
well?”  I  barely  had  the  courage  to  respond—I  was  too  shy  to  even
knock on a faculty cabin door, and also too scared to ask questions,
even inside a faculty cabin.

But  the  department  changed  me.  Slowly,  it  became  a  place  where  I
wasn’t afraid to speak up. What once felt like a battleground turned
into  a  comfort  zone.  I  learned  that  it’s  okay  not  to  have  all  the
answers,  that  confusion  is  just  the  first  step  toward  clarity.
Economics, which once seemed like dry theory to me, began to unfold
its  real  beauty—how  it  connects  to  the  world  around  us,  to  real
people,  real  issues.  I  began  to  appreciate  the  subject,  not  as  a
burden,  but  as  a  way  of  thinking.  Today,  when  I  attend  research
conferences  and  present  papers,  I  look  back  at  that  shy,  unsure
version  of  myself  and  think—wow,  we’ve  come  a  long  way.  And
somewhere  along  the  way,  SNUC  also  rekindled  my  love  for  writing.
Through SiNews, with curious juniors by my side, ideas found wings—
and so did I.

Now, enough of the serious talk—let’s get to the heart of what made
SNUC unforgettable: the fun. Beyond the notebooks and lectures (yes,
my  unofficial  full-time  job),  there  were  canteen  gossip  sessions,
impromptu  class  plans,  conversations  with  people  from  different
states and cultures, and endless laughter that became core memories.

12

Every  conversation,  every  face,  brought  a  new  perspective  and  left
behind  a  piece  of  inspiration.  From  Open  House  to  Invente,  from
Instincts to those late-night assignment journeys, from raising course
concerns  to  planning  group  activities  —  it  was  chaotic,  yes.  But
beautifully  so.  Our  class  representatives  were  the  unsung  heroes,
juggling a thousand things at once, bridging the gap between students
and  faculty,  and  somehow  staying  sane  in  the  middle  of  it  all.  Hats
off to them—they were the glue that held us together, and above all,
it was ours.

Looking  back,  I  realize  that  SNUC  gave  me  more  than  just  an
education—it  taught  me  life.  It  taught  me  cooperation,  coordination,
compromise,  leadership  (event  management  and  managing  juniors—
kind, curious, and sometimes chaotic), and perhaps most importantly
—resilience.  It  taught  me  that  showing  up  matters,  that  win  or  lose,
there’s grace in participation.

These  three  years  have  flown  by  in  the  blink  of  an  eye,  and  while  I
won’t get a second chance to recreate them, if I could, I would walk
the  same  path  again—without  changing  a  thing.  SNUC,  you’ve  been
more than just a university. You’ve been home.

I may be saying goodbye, but I’m not closing this chapter. This is a
story  I’ll  revisit  again  and  again—because  SNUC  isn’t  just  where  I
studied;  it’s  where  I  found  my  courage,  my  people,  and  most
importantly, myself.

The program commenced with students arriving in gorgeous gowns, suits etc, making
the venue more vibrant and colourful. The dance floor quickly became the focal point,
with  students  dancing,  singing  and  having  a  great  time  together.  A  wide  variety  of
food was provided, catering to diverse tastes and dietary preferences. The atmosphere
of the room was lively and bustling with action and fun.

At  the  end,  the  students  were  asked  to  vote,  in  order  to  select  their  Prom  King  and
Queen.  After  much  anticipation,  Mr.  Raja  and  Ms.  Sanjana  were  crowned  King  and
Queen  respectively.  The  event  concluded  successfully,  with  students  taking  a  group
photo to commemorate their first year at the law school.

The  School  of  Law  held  elections  for  the  Student  Executive  Council  (SEC)  of  the  new
Moot Court Society on 7 May 2025. The elections took place in the Reading Room of the
Law School building, in the presence of Faculty Coordinator Prof. Riya Chipre.

The  positions  being  contested  for  were  President,  Vice  President,  General  Secretary,
Treasurer,  Research  and  Training  Head,  and  Events  &  Communications  Head.
Elections  took  place,  beginning  with  a  round  of  campaign  speeches.  Chits  were  then
circulated,  and  students  wrote  in  their  preferred  candidates’  names.  By  evening,  the
results  were  announced  –  four  of  the  positions  were  filled,  but  votes  for  the  post  of
President was tied, and re-elections for the same were held the next day.

To  commemorate  the  end  of  the  Contracts  course,  a  Quiz  was  held  on  its  very  last
session.  The  quiz  while  trying  to  reinforce  students’  understanding  of  key  concepts
covered throughout the semester, also served as a fun and entertaining getaway.

The whole class got into teams of fours to compete in the quiz. The quiz, conducted by
fellow  students  Mr.  Raja  and  Mr.  Narain,  featured  various  multiple-choice  questions,
ranging  from  identifying  case  names  from  their  facts,  to  recalling  section  numbers
and  to  answering  general  questions  on  key  concepts.  As  soon  as  the  quiz  began,  the
room erupted with animated discussions and friendly banter, with each team eager to
outdo the others. Throughout the session, the room was buzzing with excitement and
anticipation,  as  each  competing  team  were  desperately  trying  to  put  their  hands  out
first, to bag the opportunity to answer.

Surprisingly, two teams finished on the same note, scoring the same points. Hence, a
tie breaker of drafting an exclusion clause was decided by the faculty. This was then
won by team Legatt Baby, who were ultimately declared the winners of the Contracts
Quiz.  The  event  was  a  perfect  blend  of  learning  and  laughter,  marking  a  memorable
and spirited conclusion to the Contracts course.

A Virtual Summer Bookathon, organized by the English Literary Club, was held on 17
May  2025.  Conducted  online,  the  event  brought  together  passionate  readers  for  a
lively and engaging experience.

The  event  invited  the  students  to  share  the  books  they  had  been  reading  over  the
summer break, along with personal reflections and reading experiences. Participants
exchanged insights, recommendations, and reviews, sparking meaningful discussions
around diverse genres.

The bookathon proved to be a great opportunity for the participants to discover new
genres and broaden their reading preferences.
