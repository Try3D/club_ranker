# Vol 5 Issue 1

A Virtual Summer Bookathon, organized by the English Literary Club, was held on 17
May  2025.  Conducted  online,  the  event  brought  together  passionate  readers  for  a
lively and engaging experience.

The  event  invited  the  students  to  share  the  books  they  had  been  reading  over  the
summer break, along with personal reflections and reading experiences. Participants
exchanged insights, recommendations, and reviews, sparking meaningful discussions
around diverse genres.

The bookathon proved to be a great opportunity for the participants to discover new
genres and broaden their reading preferences.
