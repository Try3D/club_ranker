THE BASICS OF ML PLATFORMS AND TOOLS

Susena  V  and  Ipsita  Kar,  both  from  B.Tech  AI&DS,  3   year,  led  the  SNUC  Coding  Club's
online  event,  The  Basics  of  ML  Platforms  and  Tools:  Your  Gateway  to  Data  Science,  on  20
January  2025.  The  session  provided  a  foundational  introduction  to  Machine  Learning
platforms, essential tools, and the Python library Pandas.

The event aimed to demystify data science for beginners, offering clear explanations of key
concepts  and  practical  applications.  Participants  gained  insights  into  the  fundamental
building  blocks  of  machine  learning,  enabling  them  to  explore  further  in  the  field.  It
successfully  served  as  a  valuable  entry  point  into  the  world  of  data  science,  providing
participants with the necessary knowledge to begin their journey.

BERT & BEYOND - MODERN BERT IN ACTION

The  Coding  Club  presented  BERT  &  Beyond  -  Modern  BERT  in  Action"  on  9  February  2025,
led by Muthu Palaniappan M from B.Tech AI&DS, 4  year. This online event provided a deep
dive into the intricacies of Modern BERT and its transformative impact on Natural Language
Processing  workflows.  Participants  from  various  academic  years  attended,  demonstrating
widespread interest in this cutting-edge technology.

The  session  explored  the  advanced  capabilities  of  BERT,  offering  practical  insights  into  its
application within NLP. Participants gained a comprehensive understanding of how Modern
BERT  optimizes  and  enhances  various  NLP  tasks.  The  event's  online  format  facilitated
accessibility,  allowing  a  large  and  diverse  audience  to  engage  with  the  material.  BERT  &
Beyond  successfully  delivered  valuable  knowledge  and  practical  skills,  equipping
participants with a deeper understanding of Modern BERT's role in contemporary NLP

EDITA-CTF

On  2  May  2025,  the  Coding  Club  organized  EditaCTF,  an  exciting  Capture  The  Flag  (CTF)
event.The competition introduced students to the world of ethical hacking, where they had
to find and exploit vulnerabilities, reverse-engineer software, and capture hidden flags.

Designed  with  beginner-friendly  challenges,  the  event  made  it  easier  for  students  to  grasp
core CTF concepts while experiencing the thrill of cybersecurity problem-solving firsthand.

More than just a competition, EditaCTF was a stepping stone for students to explore ethical
hacking  beyond  the  campus.  It  provided  a  collaborative  and  engaging  space  where
participants could develop technical skills, learn new attack and defense strategies, and get
a  taste  of  real-world  security  challenges.  With  a  mix  of  teamwork,  logic,  and  coding,  the
event  sparked  interest  in  cybersecurity  and  encouraged  students  to  dive  deeper  into  CTF
competitions in the future.
