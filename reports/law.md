The  Shiv  Nadar  School  of  Law,  in  hopes  of  helping  students  relax  and  celebrate  the
end  of  the  academic  year,  hosted  a  prom  on  3  May  2025.  The  event  took  place  in  the
school’s  cafeteria,  which  was  transformed  into  a  ballroom  with  elegant  and  intricate
decorations, thanks to the organizing committee’s efforts.

The program commenced with students arriving in gorgeous gowns, suits etc, making
the venue more vibrant and colourful. The dance floor quickly became the focal point,
with  students  dancing,  singing  and  having  a  great  time  together.  A  wide  variety  of
food was provided, catering to diverse tastes and dietary preferences. The atmosphere
of the room was lively and bustling with action and fun.

At  the  end,  the  students  were  asked  to  vote,  in  order  to  select  their  Prom  King  and
Queen.  After  much  anticipation,  Mr.  Raja  and  Ms.  Sanjana  were  crowned  King  and
Queen  respectively.  The  event  concluded  successfully,  with  students  taking  a  group
photo to commemorate their first year at the law school.

The School of Law held elections for the Student Executive Council (SEC) of the new
Moot Court Society on 7 May 2025. The elections took place in the Reading Room of the
Law School building, in the presence of Faculty Coordinator Prof. Riya Chipre.
The positions being contested for were President, Vice President, General Secretary,
Treasurer, Research and Training Head, and Events & Communications Head.
Elections took place, beginning with a round of campaign speeches. Chits were then
circulated, and students wrote in their preferred candidates’ names. By evening, the
results were announced – four of the positions were filled, but votes for the post of
President was tied, and re-elections for the same were held the next day.

To commemorate the end of the Contracts course, a Quiz was held on its very last
session. The quiz while trying to reinforce students’ understanding of key concepts
covered throughout the semester, also served as a fun and entertaining getaway.
The whole class got into teams of fours to compete in the quiz. The quiz, conducted by
fellow students Mr. Raja and Mr. Narain, featured various multiple-choice questions,
ranging from identifying case names from their facts, to recalling section numbers
and to answering general questions on key concepts. As soon as the quiz began, the
room erupted with animated discussions and friendly banter, with each team eager to
outdo the others. Throughout the session, the room was buzzing with excitement and
anticipation, as each competing team were desperately trying to put their hands out
first, to bag the opportunity to answer.
Surprisingly, two teams finished on the same note, scoring the same points. Hence, a
tie breaker of drafting an exclusion clause was decided by the faculty. This was then
won by team Legatt Baby, who were ultimately declared the winners of the Contracts
Quiz. The event was a perfect blend of learning and laughter, marking a memorable
and spirited conclusion to the Contracts course.

HERITAGE WALK

On  5  January  2025,  the  students  of  the  Shiv  Nadar
School  of  Law  attended  the  Heritage  Walk  hosted  by
Senior  Advocate  Mr.  N.L.  Rajah  at  the  Madras  High
Court.  The  walk  aimed  to  explore  the  rich  history  and
architectural  grandeur  of  one  of  India’s  oldest  judicial
institutions.

The  first  destination  was  the  Court’s  Museum,  where
the  onlookers  heard  about  the  early  days  of  the
institution  from  its  colonial  origins  under  British  rule
to the court’s historical evolution.

The museum also consisted of a model exhibit of the Madras High Court, indicating that it is
not  only  a  cornerstone  of  the  Indian  legal  system  but  also  a  magnificent  example  of  Indo-
Saracenic architecture.

The  participants  then  embarked  on  a  journey  around  the  Court’s  premises,  observing  the
fascinating  details  and  structure  of  the  entity.  The  4  various  lighthouses,  which  was
explored  by  the  participants  as  part  of  the  walk,  are  a  very  distinct  and  unique  feature  of
the  Court  which  is  not  seen  anywhere  else.  The  tour  helped  students  appreciate  the  true
complexity of the Madras High Court, which serves both of as hub of judicial authority, legal
principles and jurisprudence and also as an architectural marvel enduring the test of time.
