https://snucdelta.notion.site/Making-API-Calls-in-Javascript-123ec99419b38018a260f7a5f030ba70?pvs=4

a bunch of people who are attempting the task from today’s session reached out with a bunch of questions. to help people who have questions and not asked them as well, i’ve written a quick guide sorta document outlining making api requests in javascript

feel free to reach out with any questions you might have, or if any part of this guide is a little unclear. 

and im super happy with the number of people who are attempting the task even tho we didnt have enough time to cover everything in the session. 

tomorrow make sure to brainwash your friends who might not be attempting to task to do it give it a try as well 😛

Hi everyone, this is shared to help you learn and understand the fundamentals of JavaScript. 
Completing and learning from this will be beneficial for you. 
However, not completing it will not impact the criteria used to select students for mentorship. It is based only on your performance and interest later.

Please ensure that your academic work is not interrupted by any of these activities and plan accordingly.

Happy coding!

[20/10/24, 15:27:37] Joshua Bharathi SNU AIDS: Guys please keep in mind that at the end of the day, it’s important that you learn to manage your time spent on the curriculum and time spend on whats beyond the curriculum. 

unfortunately thats something which we cannot help you in and is something you get used to at an individual bases. We can however tell you with confidence that it’s very important you do so.

Our academic calendar is built in such a way that there is always some test or the other at any given month. This means that unless you figure out a way to study when you need to study, and dedicate other time to work, you would never be able to find time.

Striking that balance is only possible through trial and error and might be especially hard if this is the first semester exams you are facing, but i really urge everyone to make sure you satisfy your academic needs while being aware that it shouldn’t be the _only_ thing you are doing

[20/10/24, 22:37:01] Joshua Bharathi SNU AIDS: Hey all, reminder for tomorrow’s session!

now that we have some basic js syntax out of the way, we will continue to understand what an API is, learn to use one, and and build one with this library called express js!

we are finally getting into a place where we can build some meaningful stuff lol, rather than write silly programs like writing into a file and reading form it :p

timings are 1:15-3:30pm 
and at AB3 seminar hall

this would be our last offline session. looking forward to seeing you all in person for the last time for a long time!
[20/10/24, 22:38:23] Joshua Bharathi SNU AIDS: 2nd year people, whoever having cat tomorrow, can someone dm me the contact details and name of the faculty? i’ll try talking to them to possibly move the timings

We know there are a lot of events happening, but we’d love for you to join us for the "Your First Steps in Data Science and ML" session hosted by the SNUC Coding Club tomorrow at AB3 Seminar Hall from 1 PM IST onwards. This isn't just another tech talk...it’s an opportunity to get hands-on, ask questions, and really dive into topics in DS and beyond.

Agenda

- Conceptual Clarity: Understand complex concepts through relatable, real-world examples.
- Career Insights: What skills does the market need, and how can you get started learning them?
- Hands-on Learning: Live coding session covering the ML Pipeline.
- Q&A

Finally, we are launching a resource blog that will cover a lot of information to help you get started and enhance your journey in this field (details will be shared during the event). We look forward to seeing you there :)

[28/10/24, 23:49:54] Joshua Bharathi SNU AIDS: Hi all, 

Here are the CC there are a load of things that we want to do, yet so little time. rather so little “Mondays”.

We being a non residential college, means half the population wouldn’t be available in person for hands on stuff post 3:30PM.

(There are a set of buses that leave at 5:45PM which go to almost any place in chennai)

The culture we’ve had for the past few years indicated that sessions after 3:30PM until 5:30PM, didn’t make sense.

However a bunch of have some gut feels that this might have changed with the freshers batch. That the culture has changed to a point where most people would be willing to stay back for more serious skill development opportunities.

We wanted to confirm if this hypothesis is true. Please vote in the poll below

[30/10/24, 22:15:19] Joshua Bharathi SNU AIDS: i spoke to a bunch of you regarding sessions over diwali and the emotion has been pretty strong lol. so im assuming its better to have it in the post nov 3rd.

in the meantime, i am preparing a mini project guide document so that you dont loose touch. will likely drop it tonight or early tomorrow

These are some of THE biggest quants globally, so do give it a shot if you're interested. Registration is free.
[08/07/25, 12:27:12] Abdullah Sheriff SNU AIDS: Jane street, Optiver, etc. pay 6 cr. packages to a few people I know at IIT-M who got hired.

This is a good lateral xD

Links will be sent out at 4pm.

I understand this sucks because you will have to miss the bus without context on wether or not you are shortlisted

But we tried our best to get the list. It seems like sourcing the list right now would take longer than 4pm

[28/07/25, 16:40:15] Joshua Bharathi SNU AIDS: Whoever is in this list, and either

1. Left home because you didn't notice your name in SSN list
2. Didn't get link at all

Please dm me asap
[28/07/25, 20:46:52] Joshua Bharathi SNU AIDS: I heard that there has been information that has circulated that only people who were on the list, but didn't attend the test today, will be able to attend it at 830am tomorrow.

This is false 

Only people affected in the below criteria will be allowed to attend:
1. Shortlist issues: intermixing between SSN and snu lists
2. Platform issues: name was on the list, but didn't get mail
3. Anticheat issues: wrongly blocked out by anticheat false positives
4. Delayed resolutions: those who got above issues resolved very late and didn't have ample time to take the test properly.

There will be no other case where retaking in the morning tomorrow will be permitted.

[31/08/25, 22:11:12] ~ Nitin Karthick: what you on about, wsl quite literally beginner shit
[31/08/25, 22:11:31] ~ Nitin Karthick: better than VMs if you don't have the memory or dual boot
[31/08/25, 22:12:24] ~ Aprameyan: Wait so if you use wsl can you install packages and all that normally?
[31/08/25, 22:12:31] ~ Aprameyan: Or is there extra steps
[31/08/25, 22:12:32] ~ Nitin Karthick: you just connected vsc to remote wsl 😭
you open vsc on a local folder and it goes away :/
[31/08/25, 22:13:01] ~ Narendra S: yeah?
[31/08/25, 22:13:21] ~ Narendra S: and if you're wsl2 (which you most likely are) you can use linux gui apps too

[31/08/25, 22:19:47] Vishal SNU CYBER: Nix is one of the best distros 🙏
[31/08/25, 22:20:18] Vishal SNU CYBER: and by Light which parameter are you referring to?
[31/08/25, 22:20:32] ~ Narendra S: this tbh, light is pretty subjective
[31/08/25, 22:20:49] ~ Narendra S: arch is just minimal ootb; and not the only distro out there that is minimal
[31/08/25, 22:20:56] ~ Aprameyan: Well by light I meant what didnt have as many background processes
[31/08/25, 22:20:57] Vishal SNU CYBER: Yeah but let's just assume he is referring to Memory Consumption when the system is Idle
[31/08/25, 22:21:01] ~ Aprameyan: That took up ram
[31/08/25, 22:21:02] ~ Narendra S: heck it isn't even the most minimal if you wanna go by that metric
[31/08/25, 22:21:18] ~ Narendra S: I ran debian with kde on a dabba from 2013 with 4 gigs of ddr3 ‎<This message was edited>
[31/08/25, 22:21:33] Prajesh: For most people, light is something lighter than windows, and the safest option where everything works is ubuntu imo
[31/08/25, 22:21:34] Vishal SNU CYBER: Vanilla Debian is OP ‎<This message was edited>
[31/08/25, 22:21:35] ~ Aprameyan: Cool
